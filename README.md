  📘 DevOps Lab

  This repository is my personal DevOps learning lab, where I practice Linux, Git, scripting, automation, and CI/CD concepts.
  It’s a hands-on environment to explore real DevOps workflows — from writing shell scripts to managing logs and version control.


  🧱 Folder Structure

  | staging/    | Temporary testing area for CI/CD             |
  | web/        | Simple web deployment or test setups        |



  ⚙️ Scripts Overview

  | Script                          | Description                                        |
  |--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
  | scripts/count_by_extension.sh   | Counts files in a directory grouped by extension |
  | scripts/count_files.sh          | Displays total number of files in the folder    |
  | scripts/system_info.sh          | Shows OS, CPU, memory, and disk details         |
  | scripts/user_input.sh           | Demonstrates reading user input in shell scripts|
  | logs/log_cleanup.sh             | Cleans up old logs automatically                |
  | logs/generator.sh               | Generates dummy logs for testing                |


  🚀 How to Use

  1. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x logs/generator.sh logs/log_cleanup.sh scripts/*.sh`
  
  2. Generate logs: `./logs/generator.sh`
  
  3. Clean old logs: `./logs/log_cleanup.sh`
